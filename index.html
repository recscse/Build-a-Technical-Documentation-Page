                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
                    is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
                    example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                    its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
                    and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
                    structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
                    variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
                    example:
                  </p>

            <section class="main-section" id="javascript">

                <p>
                    avaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

                <code> // This will cause an error
                    function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                           greetMe("World");
                </code>

                <p>
                    You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The
                    names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
    
    
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
                </p>
                <code>var x = 42.
    
                </code>

            <section class="main-section" id="scope">
                <header>Scope</header>
                <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.
    
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.
                </p>
                <code>
                    if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5
                </code>
    
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="function">
                <header>Function</header>
                <p>
                    A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
                </p>
                <code>
                    function square(number) { return number * number; }
                </code>
                <code>
                    return number * number;
                </code>
